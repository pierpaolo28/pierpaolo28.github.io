This project consisted of developing an interactive whiteboard client/server that pairs of users could have used to view pictures, shapes, etc., drawn by each other on their respective Raspberry Piâ€™s. This involved implementing a suitable GUI for the send and receive windows, devising a protocol to exchange drawings and physically communicating using the GPIO pins.
