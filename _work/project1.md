As part of this project, has been created a web-scraping tool using UIPath to open Chrome and loop through all the
Amazon pages of a chosen category. In this way, it can then be stored, for each article in the category, the name, price and link in a CSV file. Finally, it
is then possible to analyse this file (using python ML algorithms) to
see how prices changes with time and compare with different suppliers.
