Created an animated representation of a Machine Learning model while
training for classification purposes (eg. Logistic Regression,
Artificial Neural Network). A picture of the decision boundary is
taken during all the training iterations and then an Animated GIF
automatically is created using all the stored images. This
representation has been implemented for Keras models and custom made
classifiers. Additionally a diagram representation of Artificial
Neural Networks has been implemented using the ann_visualizer library.
