This project consisted of designing and building a voice-activated
autonomous robot. The intuitiveness of our robot made it ideal for
general public use. This robot, was in fact designed to accomplish tasks able to bring great value to both general users and particularly assisting impaired people.

The demonstration my group provided during this hackathon consisted of
locating a drink and serving it to its user. However, the robot is not
limited to this task and has the potential to empower their users
with its wide variety of applications.

The robot harnesses a multitude of different technologies such as
voice-assistive technology using Google cloud’s Google Assistant API
or the machine learning techniques that allow it to detect various
object and faces.

The program for the robot is executed on a raspberry pi coupled with
an Arduino to allow a low consumption of power. The efficiency of our
robot results in low cost and small environmental impact.

The raspberry-pi is used to perfect the voice recognition of the
system as well as the field vision. The Arduino board is used to power
the servo motors and serial communications. Although the main base
of the robot was built using the "inventor fit" for RedBot, 3D printed
parts were tailored for the task specifications.
