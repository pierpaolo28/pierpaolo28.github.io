Developed a suite of games designed to help children's affected by disabilities. These games are synchronised with a wireless EEG wearable device used to register the children brain activities. Analysing the brainwaves data, using Machine Learning, has then been possible to correctly classify with 96.9% accuracy if a child is affected or not by autism.
