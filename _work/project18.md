On this project page, is freely available to download a GUI based machine learning classifier created using Tkinter and Tensorflow VGG16 pre-trained classifier. The original Python program, has in fact been converted into an executable using Pyinstaller and NSIS (in order to download just the needed dependencies to create the EXE file, a virtual environment has been used).
