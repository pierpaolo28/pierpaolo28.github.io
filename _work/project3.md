In this group project, a smart lamp called Jarvis was created. One of the key features of this smart lamp was its ability to regulate itself the light brightness intensity according to how much light was detected in the environment around. Additionally, it could have been turned on and off just by clapping your hands and was integrated with Amazon Alexa for remote voice control.
