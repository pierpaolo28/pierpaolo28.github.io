                        <p>As a Research Data Scientist, I collaborated with a variety of business clients in sectors such as finance, retail and e-commerce.  In each business project, I worked with clients to plan and deliver specialised solutions to solve their commercial data problems. One of the most interesting projects I worked on was analysing how changes in Stock Prices can affect different company shares parameters (Level 2 Data) and how these can be predicted. To do so, different techniques such as Feature Selection/Engineering and Ensemble Learning have been employed. This role has developed my ability to work to a deadline to produce an excellent product, utilising technologies such as Google Cloud APIs, A/B testing and version control tools (e.g. Git).</p>
