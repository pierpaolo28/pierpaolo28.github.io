## Takeaway Points

### Introduction

Product Management encompasses 7 key disciplines:
- Product Design
- Economics
- Psychology
- Data Science
- User Experience
- Law & Policy
- Marketing & Growth

### Product Design
There are two types of products can possibly be created: creating something entirely new (0-1 innovation/vertical progress) or creating a new iteration of an existing product (1-N innovation/horizontal progress). 0-1 focuses on building products for market-fit, while 1-N is about scaling. To find the right idea to solve, we then need to look for groups of people that are highly motivated to do something but dissatisfied with the existing solutions and then target them as our future user market.

While working on 1-N products it is then always important to lookout for potential 0-1 innovations since competition might take advantage of radical changes in the tech landscape to take your product out of business. On the other hand, having 1-N products in your company portfolio is as important since these are the products that can provide you with a steady revenue that you can then use to finance your experiments building 0-1 products. This principle perfectly aligns with the BCG growth-share matrix. 

In this case our 1-N products can be represented by the Cash Cows (low growth but strong market dominance) and 0-1 products by question marks (which have high growth potential and can potentially turn into stars one day).

#### 0-1

When building 0-1 it is then important to find spaces with low initial competition. These can typically be scenarios where we make a service to:
- Build supply for an unfulfilled demand (e.g. e-scooters for middle-distance transportation)
- Exploit untapped supply with an existing demand (e.g. a newly discovered deposit of gold)
- Match untapped supply with unfulfilled demand (e.g. two-sided market products like Airbnb)

Once found the product you want to build, you need to make sure it can be 10x better or cheaper than the existing competition to overcome possible inertia of customers to switch or join.

#### 1-N
The main problems that 1-N products try to solve are: staying relevant, defending market share from competitors, add new features, keep profit margins to increase, improve customer experience, etc.

To ensure 1-N products don't get disrupted by competition they should then try to have some form of hard-to-copy advantages such as:
- A strong brand
- Network effects
- Economies of scale
- Making offers that competitors can't match
- Unique Technology
- Switching Costs
- Knowledge of processes
- Captured resources (e.g. patents, teams)

#### Hypothesis Testing

In order to validate the idea for a new product it is then important to list out all the assumptions we are making about why this idea should work and use different research methods to test them (e.g. surveys, interviews, field studies, focus groups, diary studies, etc...).

If the results look promising, we can then move on to create some early prototypes of our product, starting from simple post-its sequences to an MVP (minimum viable product). Two possible types of MVP are the: Concierge MVP (or Wizard of Oz MVP) or The Fake Door Test. In the Concierge MVP we make the actual front-end and replace a complicated back-end with actual human work. In The Fake Door Test instead we create a full blown landing page with the product description, log-in, etc.. but no actual product, so that when someone signs up we inform them that they will be notified once the product is ready. One key aspect of the MVP is that it should test our riskiest assumptions about the product and feedback to us if any unexpected changes are needed. 

Before starting any test, we should then define our own research statement:
> We believe that [user group] faces [problem]. We think [solution] could solve it. We will know we are right if we see [metrics change].

Once finished the MVP we can then move towards creating a Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) which should focus on providing just some really well designed key features of the product to impress the users (e.g. great out of the box experience to onboard new users). The MLP should also make sure to cover any possible "cold start" problem by preloading the product with some content (e.g. example usage).

### Economics

> Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. -- Warren Buffett

#### Business Models

When selling products there are 3 possible approaches we can follow to create a profitable business: **cost leadership**, **product differentiation** and the **blue ocean strategy**.

##### Cost Leadership

In this scenario our product is like a commodity and therefore there can be no real differentiator between ourself and our competitors apart from the price. In this scenario, the only way to gain more adoption from consumers/users is to race to the bottom by lowering the price (although this might reduce our profits in the long term). 

One way to reduce prices is to reduce costs and this can be achieved for example by using **economies of scale** (the more products we sell the cheaper is for us to make them since we can negotiate better dials with suppliers, etc...). Alternatively, another possible way to reduce costs is trough **vertical integration** (e.g. buying out all the suppliers or cutting middle-mens).

##### Product Differentiation

In this scenario, we market our products as unique and justify our higher prices by showcasing some form of competitive advantage over the competition (e.g. luxury goods). If we are not able to prove users of our product superiority then our product becomes commoditized and we fall back in the cost leadership realm.

##### Blue Ocean Strategy

Finally, in this scenario we don't try to fight in a crowed market but to create a brand new one where we can offer both low cost and differentiation.

#### Market Entry

There are 3 possible ways to enter a market: building your own product, borrowing someone else product (e.g. partnering to use another company product or co-developing one) or buying another company product.

| Build | Borrow | Buy |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Company is new or short on resources | Company is not an expert in the market and doesn't want to be | Remove competitor from the market or keep product away from other competitors |
| Buying or borrowing didn't work out | You want to lean on someone else credibility | Getting the company users |
| Company has experience in a similar market | You want to quickly patch a hole | Getting in a tough to enter market |
| Piggyback off existing resources | Outsourcing the less profitable and most intensive parts of your business which would act as a liability if owned | Getting special talent not available in house |

Additionally, before considering buying another company is important to keep in mind these first questions before making a decision: Do both companies benefit from joining forces? Is the price right? Is the new industry a profitable one? Do you have to buy that company to benefit from the arrangement?

#### Moats

Economics Moat are a mean to stop competitors from invading your own market. There are 2 main types of moat: barriers to entry (e.g. high costs, regulation, intellectual property and patents) and barriers to change (switching costs, brand, network effects).

#### Unit Economics

Unit Economics measures the cost, revenue and profit of each marginal item a company sells. In the long term, how much money we make or lose for each transaction is going to greatly outweigh whatever amount of money we started with. Our margins will then dictate our future success or failure.

In Unit Economics physical good (e.g. selling laptops, pizzas, etc.) and digital goods (e.g. online ads, enterprise software) behave quite differently. Physical goods can in fact be expensive to produce and this can in turn limit our **marginal profit** on each sale. Digital products instead have a high upfront (fixed cost) but very low marginal cost (it doesn't cost almost nothing for Google to do a search query, or for Facebook to make you do a post). With digital products then increasing the scale of our users will then lead to much higher returns than when trying to scale physical goods.

This difference between physical and digital goods can also be seen when inspecting companies performance in the stock market. Investors might in fact prefer tech companies over traditional businesses since, although tech businesses incur in higher costs at the beginning, they also are much more likely to have higher profit margins and growth in the long term (therefore being able to sell their shares for a profit or earn dividend gained trough these higher margins). Potential profit shouldn't although be too far in the future because of the discounted value of money (one dollar now is worth more than one dollar in a decade since we could have invested it in the meantime and potential inflation erodes its value).
