# My Favorite picks

In order to prepare best for the event, I had the opportunity to go through most of the upcoming session and picked my 5 suggestions for you! Before getting started, if you are completely new to AWS and its Data Science & Machine Learning services, I previously wrote [this guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/aws-for-machine-learning-engineers-47e50a3b8015){:target="_blank"} in order to kickstart your AI journey with AWS.

## Use Amazon SageMaker to develop high-quality ML models faster (AIM301 - Breakout Session)

Amazon SageMaker is the AWS platform designed in order to help Data Scientists build, train, and deploy Machine Learning models. SageMaker has been proved to increase teams productivity of up to 10 times, thanks to its various built-in capabilities such as data labelling, interactive data preparation, Feature Stores, workflows, and human in the loop. As part of this session, you will have the opportunity to get an introduction to Sagemaker and it's various capabilities.

## Applying AWS machine learning to next-gen DevOps (AIM312 - Chalk Talk)

DevOps has been one of the major trends in the tech world over the last few years, completely revolutionizing how software is developed and maintained. Although, problems related to security and handling of user sensitive information can still happen if testing techniques and code reviews are not carried out correctly. As part of this session, you will learn how AWS is trying to overcome these kind of problems, by developing Machine Learning augmented DevOps tools to automate these tasks and spot anomalies in the codebase.

## Implementing  MLOps practices with Amazon SageMaker (AIM320 - Breakout Session)

MLOps (Machine Learning -> Operations) is a set of processes designed to transform experimental Machine Learning models into productionized services ready to make decisions in the real world. At his core, MLOps is based on the same principles of DevOps but with an additional focus on data validation and continuous training/evaluation. Some of the main advantages of MLOps are:

- Focus on flexibility of training/comparing different ML models.
- Improved time to market.
- Increased model robustness (easier to identify data drift, retraining models, etc.).

Going through this session, you will have the opportunity to learn how Amazon SageMaker Pipelines can help you boost automation, version ML models, improve governance and keep track of your data lineage.

## Gain greater visibility and transparency into your ML models (AIM322 - Chalk Talk)

Application of Machine Learning in ambits such as medicine, finance and education is still nowadays quite complicated due to the ethical concerns surrounding the use of algorithms as automatic decision-making tools. Two of the main causes at the root of this mistrust are: bias and low explainability. In this session, you will have an introduction to SageMaker Clarify and how it can be used in order to identify biases in your model and which features might have greater weight on your model behavior depending on different type of inputs.

## Improve  ML productivity through better feature engineering (AIM411 - Chalk Talk)

[Feature Engineering](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-engineering-techniques-9a57e4901545){:target="_blank"}, alongside with [Features Selection](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-selection-techniques-1bfab5fe0784){:target="_blank"} and [Extraction](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-extraction-techniques-d619b56e31be){:target="_blank"}, is one of the most important steps in a Machine Learning pipeline. These steps are in fact focused on creating the best possible input data to feed into a Machine Learning model, making therefore easier to achieve good results without having necessarily to use overly complicated models. As part of this session, you will have an introduction to Amazon SageMaker Feature Store and how it can be used in order to share ML features across your organizations and reuse them for different applications.
