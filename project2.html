          Hack the South - Best Hardware Design Prize Winner
        </h2>
        <p>
          This project consists of designing and building a voice-activated
          autonomous robot. The intuitiveness of our robot makes it ideal for
          general public use. The tasks it can accomplish bring great value to
          its users and particularly for assisting impaired people. <br />
          <br />
          The demonstration my group provided during this hackathon consisted of
          locating a drink and serving it to its user. However, the robot is not
          limited to this task and has the potential to empower the population
          with its wide variety of applications. <br />
          <br />
          The robot harnesses a multitude of different technologies such as
          voice-assistive technology using Google cloud’s Google Assistant API
          or the machine learning techniques that allow it to detect various
          object and faces. <br />
          <br />
          The program for the robot is executed on a raspberry pi coupled with
          an Arduino to allow a low consumption of power. The efficiency of our
          robot results in low cost and small environmental impact. <br />
          <br />
          The raspberry-pi is used to perfect the voice recognition of the
          system as well as the field vision. The Arduino board is used to power
          the servo motors and serial communications. Although the main chassis
          of the robot was built using the inventor fit for RedBot, 3D printed
          parts were tailored for the task specifications.
