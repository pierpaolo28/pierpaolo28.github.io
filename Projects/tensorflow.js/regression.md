The dataset used is for this example is the "Swedish Committee on
Analysis of Risk Premium in Motor Insurance" dataset. In this data-set, X = number of claims and Y = total payment for all the
claims in thousands of Swedish Kronor for geographical zones in Sweden.

If you are interested in a dataset analysis using Python instead of
TensorFlow.js, this is available [here.](https://github.com/pierpaolo28/Artificial-Intelligence-Projects/blob/master/Google%20AI%20tools/tensorflow.js/Regression.ipynb)

This dataset is available to download [here.](https://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/slr/frames/frame.html)

For additional information, the [tensorflow.js documentation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples) is a great place where to start.
