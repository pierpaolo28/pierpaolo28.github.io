# Augmented Reality (AR) Business Card

Creation of my personal Augmented Reality (AR) Business Card using AR.js.  <br>

The marker used to activate the AR card can be found [here](https://github.com/pierpaolo28/pierpaolo28.github.io/blob/master/Projects/ARCard/pattern-Picture.png). My business card with the marker can instead be found [there](https://github.com/pierpaolo28/pierpaolo28.github.io/blob/master/Projects/ARCard/ARBusinessCard.pdf). <br>
 
A simple demo of the AR card in action can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vswyZpXOtE). <br>

To use my card in Augmented reality version, just go to this 
[link](https://ppiconsulting.dev/Projects/ARCard/arcard.html) and point your phone camera to the marker. <br> 

To interact with any of the menu items, just direct the pointer on them (by moving your camera) and wait for a few seconds. <br>
